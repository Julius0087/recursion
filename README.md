# recursion
A series of scripts to practice recursion in Ruby, by The Odin Project curriculum.

## About
This repository contains two Ruby scripts, one for fibonacci sequence methods (non-recursive and recursive) and the other for merge sort method.

## Thoughts
This TOP assignment took me a while, especially the fibonacci recursive method. The merge sort felt more natural and understandable and was actually really fun to code.
